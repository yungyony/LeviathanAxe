# LeviathanAxe
"The Approved Feature of this project is the combat of the Leviathan Axe from the newer editions of the God of War games."
"The main focus is on aiming and throwing the axe, hitting a wall or enemy, and then recalling the axe into the player's hand."
"To test the feature, hold the Left Control button on your keyboard, then either click the Left or Right mouse buttons."
"I have also added melee combat using the same controls, minus clicking and holding the Control button."
Developed with Unreal Engine 5
